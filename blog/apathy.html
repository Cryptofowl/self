        <h1>Apathy: The Other Ruling Class</h1>
        <p>One of the most influential groups within a democracy is, paradoxically, its non-voters. Elections are often decided less by swing voters who carefully consider each candidate and their policies without affiliation or prior bias, but instead by the people that decide to stay home.</p>
        <p>That said, apathy is a valid political expression. If you don't care enough to vote then you are accepting the status quo and the direction of those in power by default. You trust that things will be worked out, regardless of your input. At best, it is the choice to cede power to other voters through non-voting. At worst, it is a vote cast without care whatsoever.</p>
        <p>Within this belief there can be both good apathy, which is contentedness with the status quo, and bad apathy, which is disenfranchisement, ignorance, and a belief that one's vote is inconsequential.</p>
        <p>To serve good governance, it is essential to give more weight to the people who care enough to pay close attention, otherwise delegates and representatives are easily able to concentrate the political power of the apathetic and wield disenfranchisement to their personal benefit.</p>
        <p>Governance, in practice, is divided between a small group of people who do things. These people know each other, coordinate, and compete. But, the division of their power isn't equal, and it is rarely in proportion to their ability to serve the public or private interests of their constituents, and instead by biases such as incumbency, availability (how often their name appears), recency (how recently the voter saw their name), and other appeals to emotion or cognitive bias.</p>
        <p>Asking everyone to know everything is unreasonable, even impossible in an endlessly complex world. This is why we delegate to representatives in the first place. But how often do voters know enough to hold their representatives accountable? Of the voters who do, how much are they outweighed by the apathetic? If we ask everyone to pay such close attention to properly monitor the actions of their representatives, then why do we need to delegate in the first place?</p>
        <p>It is impossible for one representative to perfectly represent an unlimited number of constituents in the same way it is impossible for an unlimited number of constituents to force accountability on a single representative.</p>
        <p>In the times before instant global communication and the all-powerful state apparatus, governance was performed peer to peer in communal, tribal, clan, and familial structures. People who knew each other, knew each other's values, and could quickly coordinate up and down the chain to affect action. The distribution of power was not always equal or rational, varying a lot when comparing the power structures of patriarchal, matriarchal, and religious societies, but generally accountability was strong and monitoring costs were decreased due to the high degree of shared trust.</p>
        <p>I suggest that there is an upper limit on the effectiveness of delegation, and that apathy and seasonality rapidly take over as the primary political force. If one were to graph the efficiency of delegation, it would rapidly rise at low constituent ratios, and rapidly fall at high constituent ratios.</p>
        <p>As such, to efficiently delegate the power of apathy to the people that care, delegates should have a relatively low constituency cap and low barrier to entry. Anyone can care enough to participate, but must maintain accountability to a small cohort of caretakers in order to reach the cap and wield equal power to other delegates. This allows the power of delegates to be quickly divided in case their representation is insufficient or malicious, and prevents the entrenchment of their power through apathy alone.</p>
        <p>Like cells, rapid growth through division can occur in order to heal a wound.</p>
        <p>For convenience and experimentation, Dunbar's number (250) would be an adequate constituency cap to observe such a system in action. Without analysis or specific context of the duties being divided, it is difficult to suggest a more precise and ideal number, which may exist in specific circumstances.</p>
        <p>At larger scales, where coordination and agent costs rapidly multiply, the system could be nested within itself in succession, with the delegates of one layer elected by peer delegates to the next.</p>
        <p>A low number of constituents serves the purposes of increasing the fidelity of representation, as well as increasing the relative power of each vote. It redistributes the advantage of apathy, while opening up participation to those who care the most.</p>
